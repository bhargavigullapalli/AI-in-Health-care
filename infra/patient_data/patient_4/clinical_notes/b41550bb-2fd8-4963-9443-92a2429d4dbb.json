  "text": "Narrative: for patients: as a result of the 21st century cures act, medical imaging exams and procedure reports are released immediately into your electronic medical record. You may view this report before your referring provider. If you have questions, please contact your health care provider. Indication: history of non-small cell lung cancer on the left. History of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Exam is being performed for restaging. Technique: patient received 10.7 millicuries of 18 fdg (18 fluorodeoxyglucose) intravenously. Pet-ct imaging has been performed from the mid skull to mid thigh level 60 minutes post injection. Ct images have been obtained for attenuation correction and localization only. Blood glucose level: 96 mg/dl. Comparison: pet-ct dated 2020-03-07. Findings: within the chest there has been significant improvement and uptake of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum and left hilum. Small residual left prevascular and right paratracheal lymph nodes are noted. Persistent subcarinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted. As example 1 cm lymph node right paratracheal region is identified with a suv max of 4.3 compared with 10.1 previously. Suv max subcarinal region 4.8 compared with 11.0 previous. Suv max left prevascular region 3.2 compared with 6.2 previously. Suv max within the left hilum is 4.3 compared with 12.4 previously. No new hypermetabolic lymph nodes in mediastinum are noted. Bilateral thyroid activity is noted. The lungs demonstrate interval decrease in size and metabolic activity within the lesion in the lingular segment posteriorly. This now measures 2.4 x 2 cm compared with 3.5 x 3.8 cm previously. Suv max is 10.3 compared with 17.6 previously. Previous small ground glass nodule anteriorly within the left upper lobe is no longer identified. No new areas uptake are noted within the lungs. The chest wall and axilla demonstrates no significant abnormal uptake. The neck demonstrates no significant abnormal uptake with symmetric salivary and oropharyngeal activity. Liver and spleen demonstrate no significant abnormal uptake. Patient is status post cholecystectomy. Increased gastric activity is identified which is likely physiologic. The pancreas and bilateral adrenal glands demonstrate no abnormal uptake. Retrocrural region and retroperitoneum demonstrate no significant abnormal uptake. Iliac nodal chain and groin demonstrate no significant abnormal uptake. There is moderate to prominent diffuse marrow activity consistent with underlying systemic therapy. No focal skeletal lesion is seen. Impression: 1. Findings are consistent with a partial response to treatment with overall improving pet-ct when compared to the prior study. 2. Significant decrease in size and metabolic activity within mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes. Residual hypermetabolic activity is noted consistent with some residual viable tumor. 3. Decreasing size and metabolic activity within the primary lesion in the posterior lingula on the left. The previous small ground-glass nodule anteriorly within the left upper lobe has resolved. 4. No suspicious findings for metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis. Dictated by david martinez, md @ 2020-08-04 14:12:18 (electronically signed)",
