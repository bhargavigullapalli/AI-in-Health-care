She has been having dysphagia mainly solids over liquids for the past 3 months, in the setting of nsclc of lingula. The nature reasons risks and possible complications of the procedure were explained to her and she stated she understood and wished to proceed. Details of procedure: patient brought into the endoscopy suite and placed in the left lateral decubitus position whereupon o2 sat monitor blood pressure cuff and ekg leads were placed. Cardiopulmonary status was normal pre-and postprocedure and monitored throughout. A time-out was then performed and the patient's identity along with the procedure to be performed was agreed upon by the surgical team. Iv sedation was administered. A bite block was inserted into the patient's mouth. A video endoscope was then passed through the bite block and carefully guided down the esophagus. The vocal cords and arytenoid cartilages were visualized and noted to be normal. The gastroesophageal junction was noted to be at approximately 36 cm from the incisors. The z line appeared regular, but there was a tight stricture with narrowing at the ge junction from chronic fibrosis, consistent with shatzki's ring. A picture of this was taken. The scope was then advanced into the stomach and no gastritis or gastropathy was found in the antral area. Pictures of this was taken. The pylorus was then intubated and the scope was passed into the duodenum up to its third portion. There were no significant abnormalities noted here. Cold biopsies were taken from the first portion of the duodenum. The scope was then brought back into the stomach and cold biopsies were taken from the antral area and sent for pathology and helicobacter pylori analysis. The scope was then retroflexed and no hiatal hernia was noted. This was also photo documented. The hill grade of the gastroesophageal valve revealed to be 2. Dilation was done with balloon, up to 15 mm across. The ge junction where stricture was present. This was done for 2 minutes, and no complications were noted afterwards.
