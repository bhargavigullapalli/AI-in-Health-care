Doe  \nAge: 59 y.o.  \nMedical record number: 0001024407  \nPrimary provider: Olivia Davis, PA  \n\nReason for visit: Patient with non-small cell lung cancer, likely stage IV disease.\n\nHPI: Jane M. Doe is a 59-year-old woman who presented in early December with increased chest heaviness and chest pain. A CT scan was performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolus, which was negative, but revealed a moderate large area of consolidation in the inferior lingula of the left lung, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, including a calcified granuloma in the right middle lobe, and mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy. A repeat CT scan on 2020-02-21 showed the lingular mass was approximately the same size, with a new 8 mm nodule by the aorta and a slightly increased nodule by the right diaphragm. A PET scan on 2020-03-07 showed a left-sided supraclavicular lymph node (5 mm, SUV 3.6), a hypermetabolic lingular mass (3.4 x 3.8 cm, SUV 18.4), and a hypermetabolic pulmonary nodule in the right lung base (8 mm, SUV 3.7). Numerous hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes were also noted, including a subcarinal lymph node (1.4 cm, SUV 11.0). The patient was seen by pulmonary on 2020-03-10, and an EBUS showed positive lymph nodes involving 74R and the left lingula, consistent with adenocarcinoma. Further testing is pending. The patient continues to experience pleuritic pain, likely due to pleural invasion. Given the last CT scan was on 2020-01-04, a repeat CT scan with contrast is recommended to reevaluate the lymph nodes and nodules before starting treatment. The patient appears to have stage IV disease, making treatment decisions challenging. Radiation and chemotherapy are not typically indicated for stage IV disease, but a consultation with radiation therapy may be beneficial if there is a response to systemic treatment.\n\nAllergies: No known allergies\n\nPast Medical History: \n- Insomnia, unspecified (G47.00)\n- Mixed hyperlipidemia (E78.2)\n- Lumbar radiculitis (M54.16)\n\nCurrent Medications:\n- Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 10 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (10 mg) by mouth 3 times daily if needed for muscle spasm. 30 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Diclofenac topical (Voltaren) 1% gel: Apply 4 g topically to affected area(s) four times daily. 100 g, 0 refills.\n- Ibuprofen (Advil; Motrin) 800 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (800 mg) by mouth every 8 hours if needed for pain. 100 tablets, 3 refills.\n- Ondansetron (Zofran) 8 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (8 mg) by mouth every 8 hours if needed for nausea/vomiting. 30 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Pravastatin (Pravachol) 40 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime. 90 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Pregabalin (Lyrica) 75 mg capsule: Take 2 capsules by mouth at bedtime. 180 capsules, 1 refill.\n- Prochlorperazine (Compazine) 10 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (10 mg) by mouth every 8 hours if needed for nausea/vomiting. 30 tablets, 1 refill.\n- Trazodone (Desyrel) 100 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet (100 mg) by mouth at bedtime if needed for sleep. 90 tablets, 3 refills.\n\nNo current facility-administered medications for this visit.

The PET scan shows a hypermetabolic lingular mass invading the pleura, a small nodule in the left lung, and a hypermetabolic nodule in the right lung base. The patient also has a positive supraclavicular lymph node. Given the stage IV disease, the treatment plan will focus on systemic therapy. The plan is to start the patient on systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Radiation therapy will be considered for palliative purposes if needed. The patient will be referred to radiation oncology for further evaluation. We had a detailed discussion about the treatment options and the prognosis. The patient will receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy every 3 weeks, followed by maintenance pembrolizumab. No evidence of metastatic disease outside the chest was found. The patient will be closely monitored, and further imaging will be done to assess the response to treatment.\n\nYour cancer nurse navigator, Michael Harrison, RN, is available for any questions or concerns at 320.225.3.\n\nTotal time preparing to see this patient, face-to-face time, and coordinating care time on the same calendar date: 63 minutes.\n\nRonald Bastianson, MD  \nMedical Oncologist, Hematologist  \nHealth",
