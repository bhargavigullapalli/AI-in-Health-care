Doe  \nAge: 59 y.o.  \nMedical record number: 0001024407  \nPrimary provider: Olivia Davis, PA  \nReason for visit: Follow-up for non-small cell lung cancer T4N3M1a (IVA). Completed treatment with carbo/taxol/keytruda x6 cycles on 2020-09-24. Currently on treatment with Keytruda alone.\n\nHPI: Jane M. Doe is a 59 y.o. female here for follow-up of her NSCLC prior to treatment with Keytruda q21-days. On 2020-12-10, the patient met with Dr. and was recommended maintenance pembrolizumab and advised against consolidative radiation. We reviewed her CT scans and brain MRI done here together and compared them with multiple prior scans. I am pleased to see that she has had a good response to therapy. However, she did have metastatic disease at diagnosis. Therefore, while there has been a response to treatment, I still favor a prolonged treatment response before any definitive therapy is considered. In my opinion, she can resume maintenance pembrolizumab locally and continue restaging scans every 3 months. She may still be a candidate for consolidative therapy down the road after several cycles.\n\n2021-02-08: Patient's labs are stable. TSH: 1.09. Continued treatment with Keytruda on 2021-02-09.\n\n2021-02-15 CT chest without contrast impression:\n1. Lingular mass now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm as opposed to 2.7 x 2.4 cm previously.\n2. Left hilar lymphadenopathy somewhat improved. No new adenopathy evident.\n3. No new pulmonary nodule. Previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule no longer evident. 7 x 6 mm left lower lobe nodule now measured at 10 x 4 mm.\n4. Coronary artery disease.\n\n2021-03-01: TSH low at 0.041, free T4 WNL at 1.54. Decreased levothyroxine dose to 75 mcg. Patient c/o dysphagia. EGD on 2021-03-11 showed a tight stricture with narrowing at the GE junction from chronic fibrosis, consistent with Schatzki's ring. Dilation was done with a balloon, up to 15 mm across. Gastric and duodenum biopsies were negative. Dysphagia improved but not resolved.\n\n2021-03-22: Keytruda administered. PET/CT impression:\n1. Increased intensely FDG avid 4.1 cm left lung mass, likely increased metabolically active adenocarcinoma.\n2. New and increased intensely FDG avid left hilar and infrahilar lymphadenopathy, likely metastatic.\n\nOncologic history:\n2020-03-07 PET/CT showed hypermetabolic lingular mass approx 3.4 x 3.8 cm with numerous mediastinal nodes, 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lung base, and metastatic left supraclavicular node. 2020-03-30 bronchoscopy with EBUS-guided FNA. Pathology diagnosis/interpretation:\nA. Lymph node, 7, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration -- metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.\nB. Lymph node, 4R, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration -- metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.\nC. Lung, left lingula, transbronchial fine needle aspiration -- non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.\nD. Lung, left lower lobe, bronchoalveolar lavage -- non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.\n\n2020-08-03: Patient underwent PET/CT which demonstrated:\n1. Findings consistent with a partial response to treatment with overall improving PET-CT when compared to the prior study.\n2. Significant decrease in size and metabolic activity within mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes. Residual hypermetabolic activity is noted consistent with some residual viable tumor.\n3. Decreasing size and metabolic activity within the primary lesion in the posterior lingula on the left. The previous small ground-glass nodule anteriorly within the left upper lobe has resolved.\n4. No suspicious findings for metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis.\n\n2020-10-22 PET: \n- Thorax: Twenty-seven by 22 millimeter lingular nodule now has a max SUV of 6.9; previously 29 by 24 millimeters with a max SUV of 10.3. \n- Subcentimeter left infrahilar node has a max SUV of 4.5, previously 4.8. \n- Subcentimeter left mid hilar node has a max SUV of 5.2, previously 4.3. \n- Ten millimeter lower paratracheal node now has a max SUV of 2.6, previously 4.3. \n- Subcarinal node measuring 12 millimeters in short axis now has a max SUV of 2.8, previously 4.8. \n- Left inferior maxillary mucous retention cyst versus polyp.\n\n2021-03-22 PET/CT impression:\n1. Increased intensely FDG avid 4.1 cm left lung mass, likely increased metabolically active adenocarcinoma.\n2. New and increased intensely FDG avid left hilar and infrahilar lymphadenopathy, likely metastatic.\n\nReceived Keytruda. As disease has progressed, will plan to discontinue pembrolizumab and start KRAS-directed treatment with adagrasib. Have patient follow up with Dr. Ravih for a second opinion.\n\n2. Hypothyroidism: TSH has been fluctuating. 2021-03-20 TSH, free T4 WNL. Levothyroxine decreased from 100 mcg to 75 mcg on 2021-03-01 and will continue this dose. Monitor TSH, free T4.\n\n3. Dysphagia: EGD on 2021-03-11 showed a tight stricture with narrowing at the GE junction from chronic fibrosis, consistent with Schatzki's ring. Dilation was done with a balloon, up to 15 mm across. Gastric and duodenum biopsies were negative. Dysphagia improved but not resolved.\n\n4. Coronary artery disease: Seen on CT. Consult placed to cardiology for further evaluation. Consult completed on 2021-03-12. Patient scheduled for a PET/CT MPI with MFR to rule out significant CAD on 2021-04-27. Stress test planned for 2021-04-27.\n\nRTC 2 weeks. Total time including both face-to-face and non-face-to-face time: 40 minutes. Time including, but not limited to, chart review, history gathering, performing medically appropriate exam, counseling, and care coordination.\n\nEli A. Miller, DO  \nHematology/Oncology",
