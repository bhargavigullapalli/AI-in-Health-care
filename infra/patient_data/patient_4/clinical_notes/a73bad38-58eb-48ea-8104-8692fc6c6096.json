  "text": "Narrative: for patients: as a result of the 21st century cures act, medical imaging exams and procedure reports are released immediately into your electronic medical record. You may view this report before your referring provider. If you have questions, please contact your health care provider. Indication: non-small cell lung cancer. Assess treatment response technique: volumetric helical scanning of the thorax was performed without iv contrast material. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were obtained. Comparison: chest ct of 2020-06-03 findings: the lingular mass is now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm on image 92 of series 2. This was previously measured at 2.7 x 2.4 cm. Left hilar lymphadenopathy appears somewhat improved. No mediastinal or right hilar adenopathy is noted. On image 77 of series 2, a noncalcified 10 x 4 mm left lower lobe nodule is demonstrated. On the previous examination, a 7 x 6 mm nodule was noted at this site. A previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule is no longer evident. No new nodule is noted. No lytic or blastic bone lesion is apparent. No acute infiltrate, significant airway abnormality or pleural effusion is demonstrated. The heart size is normal. Calcified coronary arterial plaque is again demonstrated. Images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable except for postop changes of cholecystectomy. Impression: 1. Lingular mass now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm as opposed to 2.7 x 2.4 cm previously. 2. Left hilar lymphadenopathy somewhat improved. No new adenopathy evident. 3. No new pulmonary nodule. Previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule no longer evident. 7 x 6 mm left lower lobe nodule now measured at 10 x 4 mm. 4. Coronary artery disease. Please note that all ct scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight-based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable.
