Doe  \nAge: 59 y.o.  \nMedical record number: 0001024407  \nPrimary provider: Olivia Davis, PA  \nReason for visit: Follow-up for non-small cell lung cancer T4N3M1a (IVA). Completed treatment with carbo/taxol/keytruda x6 cycles on 2020-09-24. Currently on treatment with Keytruda alone.\n\nHPI: Jane M. Doe is a 59 y.o. female here for follow-up of her NSCLC prior to treatment with Keytruda q21-days. On 2020-12-10, the patient met with Dr. and was recommended maintenance pembrolizumab and advised against consolidative radiation. We reviewed her CT scans and brain MRI done here together and compared them with multiple prior scans. I am pleased to see that she has had a good response to therapy. However, she did have metastatic disease at diagnosis. Therefore, while there has been a response to treatment, I still favor a prolonged treatment response before any definitive therapy is considered. In my opinion, she can resume maintenance pembrolizumab locally and continue restaging scans every 3 months. She may still be a candidate for consolidative therapy down the road after several cycles.\n\n2021-02-08: Patient's labs are stable. TSH: 1.09. Continued treatment with Keytruda on 2021-02-09.  \n2021-02-15: CT chest without contrast impression:  \n1. Lingular mass now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm as opposed to 2.7 x 2.4 cm previously.  \n2. Left hilar lymphadenopathy somewhat improved. No new adenopathy evident.  \n3. No new pulmonary nodule. Previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule no longer evident. 7 x 6 mm left lower lobe nodule now measured at 10 x 4 mm.  \n4. Coronary artery disease.  \n2021-03-01: TSH low at 0.041, free T4 WNL at 1.54. Decreased levothyroxine dose to 75 mcg. Patient c/o dysphagia.  \n2021-03-22: Patient scheduled for repeat PET scan. Will plan to give Keytruda after the PET scan.\n\nOncologic history:  \n2020-03-07: PET/CT hypermetabolic lingular mass approx 3.4 x 3.8 cm with numerous mediastinal nodes, 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lung base, and metastatic left supraclavicular node.  \n2020-03-30: Bronchoscopy with EBUS-guided FNA. Pathology diagnosis/interpretation:  \nA. Lymph node, 7, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration -- metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \nB. Lymph node, 4R, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration -- metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \nC. Lung, left lingula, transbronchial fine needle aspiration -- non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \nD. Lung, left lower lobe, bronchoalveolar lavage -- non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.  \n2020-08-03: Patient underwent PET/CT which demonstrated:  \n1. Findings are consistent with a partial response to treatment with overall improving PET-CT when compared to the prior study.  \n2. Significant decrease in size and metabolic activity within mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes. Residual hypermetabolic activity is noted consistent with some residual viable tumor.  \n3. Decreasing size and metabolic activity within the primary lesion in the posterior lingula on the left. The previous small ground-glass nodule anteriorly within the left upper lobe has resolved.  \n4. No suspicious findings for metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis.  \n2020-10-14: B/L LE U/S neg for DVT. TSH declined to 23.  \n2020-10-22: PET:  \nHead and neck: The paired glandular structures and muscles of the neck are symmetrical. No focal area of increased uptake is identified.  \nThorax: Twenty-seven by 22 millimeter lingular nodule now has a max SUV of 6.9; previously 29 by 24 millimeters with a max SUV of 10.3.  \n*Subcentimeter left infrahilar node has a max SUV of 4.5, previously 4.8.  \n*Subcentimeter left mid hilar node has a max SUV of 5.2, previously 4.3.  \n-10 millimeter lower paratracheal node now has a max SUV of 2.6, previously 4.3.  \n-Subcarinal node measuring 12 millimeters in short axis now has a max SUV of 2.8, previously 4.8.  \nLeft inferior maxillary mucous retention cyst versus polyp.  \nAbdomen/pelvis: No focal areas of increased uptake.  \nBones/soft tissues: No focal areas of increased uptake. Previously seen bone marrow activation has resolved.  \nAdditional CT findings include left inferior maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst versus polyp, mild carotid artery atherosclerotic calcifications, moderate atherosclerotic calcifications within the LAD, 37 millimeters dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta, benign calcified granuloma within the right lower lobe, background emphysematous changes, stable 3 millimeter left upper lobe pleural-based pulmonary nodule, post cholecystectomy, post hysterectomy, few scattered colonic diverticula, small hiatal hernia, moderate abdominal aortic atherosclerotic calcifications, and stable degenerative changes.  \nImpression: Partial response to therapy.  \n2020-12-10: Patient recently met with Dr. and was recommended maintenance pembrolizumab and he recommended against consolidative radiation. Recommended re-imaging every 3 months.  \n2021-02-09: Pembro continued.  \n12/31 CT chest impression:  \n1. Lingular mass now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm as opposed to 2.7 x 2.4 cm previously.  \n2. Left hilar lymphadenopathy somewhat improved. No new adenopathy evident.  \n3. No new pulmonary nodule. Previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule no longer evident. 7 x 6 mm left lower lobe nodule now measured at 10 x 4 mm.  \n4. Coronary artery disease.  \nPatient due for treatment on 2021-03-21 with Keytruda, but rescheduled to 2021-03-22 after the PET scan. Disease appears to be slowly progressing. Will assess with PET/CT scheduled on 2021-03-22. XRT and/or KRAS directed treatment will be considered. Have patient follow up with Dr. Ravih.

Doe is a 59-year-old female presenting for evaluation of:  \n1. NSCLC involving left lung, T4 N3 M1a (IVA).  \n- 2020-03-07 PET/CT demonstrated hypermetabolic lingular mass 3.4 x 3.8 cm with hypermetabolic mediastinal nodes, hypermetabolic 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lung base, and metastatic left supraclavicular node.  \n- 2020-03-30 bronchoscopy with EBUS-guided FNA. Pathology report from lymph nodes level 4R, 7, biopsy of LLL and BAL from LLL demonstrated adenocarcinoma.  \n- Patient was started on weekly carboplatin/taxol by Dr. Peterson with the thought that patient was going to receive definitive concurrent radiation. She received 5 weekly treatments with carboplatin/taxol with response on CT. She was determined by radiation oncology not to be a candidate for definitive chemoradiation due to the presence of a contralateral metastatic pulmonary nodule.  \n- She was recommended by Dr. Peterson to switch to carboplatin/taxol/keytruda every 3 week regimen and based on response could be considered for consolidative radiation. She has received 6 cycles completed 2020-09-24.  \n- PET/CT results from 2020-08-09 reviewed demonstrating partial response to treatment.  \n- 2020-08-10 NGS returned showing KRAS p.G12C mutation. PD-L1 neg.  \n- 2020-10-22 PET/CT showed a partial response to treatment.  \n- Referred back to Dr. Kiran of RadOnc for consideration of consolidation radiation. Order placed for patient to clinic for second opinion. I would like a recommendation regarding possible maintenance systemic treatment.  \n- 2020-12-10: Patient recently met with Dr. and was recommended maintenance pembrolizumab and he recommended against consolidative radiation. Recommended re-imaging every 3 months.  \n- 2021-02-09: Pembro continued.  \n- 12/31 CT chest impression:  \n1. Lingular mass now measured at 3.6 x 2.5 cm as opposed to 2.7 x 2.4 cm previously.  \n2. Left hilar lymphadenopathy somewhat improved. No new adenopathy evident.  \n3. No new pulmonary nodule. Previously demonstrated 5 mm right lower lobe nodule no longer evident. 7 x 6 mm left lower lobe nodule now measured at 10 x 4 mm.  \n4. Coronary artery disease.  \n- Patient due for treatment on 2021-03-21 with Keytruda, but rescheduled to 2021-03-22 after the PET scan. Disease appears to be slowly progressing. Will assess with PET/CT scheduled on 2021-03-22. XRT and/or KRAS directed treatment will be considered. Have patient follow up with Dr. Ravih. Patient is going to call and schedule an appointment.  \n2. Hypothyroidism - TSH has been fluctuating, most recently low at 0.041. Today's result is pending. Dose of levothyroxine decreased to 75 mcg on 2021-03-01. Monitor TSH, free T4.  \n3. Dysphagia. Refer to Dr. Youn for consideration of EGD. Completed on 2021-03-11.  \n4. Coronary artery disease. Seen on CT. Consult placed to cardiology for further evaluation. Consult completed on 2021-03-12. Patient scheduled for a PET/CT MPI with MFR to rule out significant CAD on 2021-04-27. If evaluation is stable, follow-up recommendation was 1 year.\n\n40 minutes spent in non-face-to-face clinical staff time with patient including coordinating care, chart review, and documentation.\n\nAva Walker, NP  \n2021-03-20 11:20:00",
