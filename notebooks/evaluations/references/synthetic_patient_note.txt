Case Discussion: Oncological History 03/15/12: Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer: Underwent left hepatic lobectomy with hepaticojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. PATHOLOGY: Infiltrating tubular adenocarcinoma of the bile duct, moderately differentiated, arising from biliary intraepithelial neoplasia. Negative for lymphovascular invasion. A separate microscopic lesion was identified in segment III of the liver. All margins were negative for malignancy. Two of nine hilar lymph nodes were positive for carcinoma. Staging: pT2a, pN1, M0. 08/10/19: Abdominal MRI/MRCP: Post-surgical changes of left hepatectomy. A 9 mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe (RUL) noted. No intrahepatic recurrence. Normal biliary drainage. 02/14/20: Chest CT: Persistent 9 mm RUL nodule, with new 5 mm nodule in the left lower lobe (LLL). No mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 03/02/20: CT-guided biopsy of RUL lesion: Metastatic adenocarcinoma, immunoprofile supports pancreatobiliary origin. Negative for TTF-1 and CDX2. NGS inconclusive due to insufficient tumor cellularity. 03/16/20: Tumor markers: CA19-9 = 32, CEA = 1.2, AFP = normal. 04/10/20: PET-CT: Mild FDG uptake in RUL nodule (SUV 3.4), no evidence of metastatic liver disease. One non-FDG-avid nodule in LLL. No pelvic or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. 06/25/20: EUS: 2.1 x 1.5 cm mass in the pancreatic body. Regional lymphadenopathy in the peripancreatic and celiac regions. PATHOLOGY: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. MMR proficient. KRAS mutation detected. Staging: Clinical Stage IV (cT2, cN2, pM1) 07/13/20: Initiated systemic therapy with modified FOLFIRINOX.
